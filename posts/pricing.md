There are **(3)** ways to subscribe. We try our best to provide immediate access
to `pico+` regardless of payment method. However, after you pay, please message
us via [email](mailto:hello@pico.sh) or [IRC](/irc) and we will grant you
membership access ASAP.

## Stripe

This is the quickest way to access `pico+`.

# Need higher limits?

We are more than happy to extend limits. Just message us and we can chat.

# Notes

We do not maintain active subscriptions for `pico+`. Every year you must pay
again. We do not take monthly payments, you must pay for a year up-front.
Pricing is subject to change because we plan on continuing to include more
services as we build them.

We provide a special RSS feed for all pico users for us to send direct
notifications. This is where we will send you `pico+` expiration notifications.
To be clear, this is opt-in because we do not collect your email address. Read
more about it on the [feeds.sh](/feeds) service.
