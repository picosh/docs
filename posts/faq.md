# Permission denied when using SSH

There are a couple reason why this might be happening. We require a public key
for authentication to all of our services, so first make sure you have a valid
SSH keypair.

Not sure what type of keys you have? You can check with the following:

```bash
find ~/.ssh/id_*.pub -exec ssh-keygen -l -f {} \;
```

After that we need to determine why our server is rejecting your public key.
What is most helpful is if you run:

```bash
ssh -vvv pico.sh
```

If you cannot figure out what is wrong just by looking at that output, then you
are more than welcome to join [irc](/irc) and send us a paste of the SSH logs.

You should also make sure you have the correct file permissions set for your ssh
folder and keys:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

# How do I force the correct pico SSH key?

There are two ways, one is when SSHing to us:

```bash
ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 pico.sh
```

The other is with an SSH config entry (`~/.ssh/config`):

```bash
Host pico.sh
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host pgs.sh
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host prose.sh
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

# Generating a new SSH key

[Github Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter.
This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.

# How can I use `git` to sync my content?

All you need is your private key and
[one of the upload tools we support](/file-uploads)

For example,
[here is how we deploy the pico blog](https://github.com/picosh/official-blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml)

# Are there any bandwidth limitations?

Currently we get 10TB egress per month through our cloud provider. We are
nowhere near that number today (~60GB/mo).

So until we reach 10TB per month, there are no bandwidth limitations.

Having said that, once we reach that number, we will average the cost across all
users.
