All of our services require users to send us files in order to manage content.
Read the [How it Works](/how-it-works) for an under-the-hood, technical summary.

# How do I upload files?

Unless otherwise specified, all our services support the following ways to
upload files.

## rsync

```bash
rsync hello-world.md {service}:/
```

For pgs:

```bash
rsync -rv public/ {service}:/site/
```

### What rsync options are supported?

Because in our golang SSH server we re-implement `rsync`, many options are
currently not supported. For example, `--delete` and `--dry-run` are not
supported. At this time, the only options we supported are the following:

- `-r`
- `-v`

## scp

```bash
scp hello-world.md {service}:/
```

for pgs:

```bash
scp -R public/ {service}:/site/
```

## sftp

```bash
sftp {service}

sftp> ls
hello-world.md

sftp> rm hello-world.md

sftp> put hello-world.md
```

# How do I update files?

Just send us the files you want to update. With [pgs.sh](/pgs) you can upload
single files to projects, but we also support "deploying" static sites with
[promotion and rollback](/pgs#project-promotion-and-rollback).

# How do I delete files?

We have a couple ways to delete files depending on your use-case.

## sftp

The easiest way to delete a file is via [sftp](#sftp).

## 0-byte file

Because `scp` does not natively support deleting files, we didn't want to bake
that behavior into our SSH Apps.

However, if a user wants to delete a post they can delete the contents of the
file and then upload it to our server. If the file contains 0 bytes, we will
remove the post. For example, if you want to delete `delete.md` you could:

```bash
cp /dev/null delete.md
scp ./delete.md prose.sh:/
```

# How do I download files?

Using the same tools described [here](#how-do-i-upload-files), just reverse the
order of `src` and `dest`!

```bash
rsync prose.sh:/ .
```
